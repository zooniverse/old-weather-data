(DeLong, Journal vol. 1 p. 135): At 1.50 am. a very curious electric phenomenon was observed. A ball of electric light formed about one quarter mile from the ship on the surface of the floe (in size about that of ""a barrel"", according to Mr. Dunbar), throwing out rays in all directions, and slowly rose and worked away from the ship, decreasing in size and brilliancy. When almost extinct it advanced again, increasing in brilliancy, and, descending to the floe, disappeared. This occurred twice in seven minutes. The appearance of the electric ball was preceded by a fine aurora. Unfortunately Mr. Dunbar, who had the watch, did not call me to see this extraordinary occurrence. Mr. Collins was called, but before he came on deck the display was over. The foregoing is made from Mr. Dunbar's description.",http://oldweather.s3.amazonaws.com/ow3/final/USS%20Jeannette/vol001of004/vol001_120_1.jpg                                                                                                                                                   https://archive.org/details/voyageofjeannett01delouoft,

(DeLong, Journal vol1 p 189)  A quiet day. We had, in addition to one of the most beautiful moonlight effects  on the ice I had ever seen, and a sky perfectly free from clouds, a fine chance to witness auroral and other  effects.  At ten p.m. a lunar rainbow was visible, showing faintly the prismatic colors. Towards eleven p. m.  this was succeeded by a lunar halo in which the prismatic colors were clearly visible. Then flared up an auroral arch, extending from N. to N. E., whose crown  was 34° in altitude, and this arch, as if by magic, absorbed the lunar halo, or caused it to disappear. Then suddenly the lunar rainbow reappeared and arched  alongside the auroral arch; and finally. At 11.50, the auroral arch became an auroral  curtain, floating sheets of trembling flame down to the horizon.  Not a sound was heard during this display. Add to this picture the ship thrown by the bright moonlight against a clear, dark blue background, every rope and spar white with  frost, and a level floe surrounded with a fringe of fantastically shaped hummocks, and it would make a study  for an artist. I have remarked heretofore that these  wonderful auroral displays, are forerunners of cold weather, and I shall watch with interest the result of  this very high barometer and extraordinary atmospheric phenomena.",http://oldweather.s3.amazonaws.com/ow3/final/USS%20Jeannette/vol001of004/vol001_189_1.jpg,

(DeLong, Journal vol. 1 p. 270): As our days lengthen the auroral displays become less frequent and less brilliant. It is impossible to assign any particular cause for their appearance, or discover any particular effect following them. They have been brilliant in intensely cold weather, and also in mild weather, and again they have been faint under similar temperature; they have existed in all winds and in calms, at full and change of the moon, when the ice has been breaking up and when it has been motionless; in fine, under all sorts and conditions of circumstances. The only prerequisite is a dry atmosphere. It has been said that these auroras are not seen over the ice. All that I can say about that is, that frequently we could see nothing but ice during displays, although there may have been water somewhere.

An exceptionally beautiful auroral display commenced shortly before midnight. From W. x S. to N.E. and chiefly south of zenith, from 10° to 15° in altitude an auroral band extended in a series of flat semi-elliptical curves opening to the N'd. On the inner or north edge of the band it was brilliantly white, while the light faded down toward the southern horizon to a pale cloud-like intensity, in which faint lines would occasionally show. To the north of zenith very meagre bands of long streamers hung across the sky. A peculiarity of the display was the regularity with which the curves, which were moving slowly along the band from W. to E. broke into rapid and distorting undulations when they aimed at a point lying within the space apparently occupied by the constellation Ursa Major. There the E. end of the curve would suddenly deepen and double back sharply, while the aurora would be violently agitated and would show the prismatic colors with extraordinary vividness. Occasionally the organization of the original curve would be maintained notwithstanding the extraordinary rapidity of the movements around its margin, but usually the curve was broken or seemed to collapse, to be succeeded by forms, in the zenith of indescribable outline because of the rapidity of changes. At times it seemed as if there were two distinct strata of aurora, the lower one being most agitated, so that the prismatic colors in modified tints crossed and recrossed each other while the whole looked like a magnificent pyrotechnic display on which various colored and intense lights were thrown. In the west the band showed occasionally that at a great distance in that direction a similar movement was in progress, while to the E'd such a movement was plainly discernible the rapid changes of the foldings in the band taking the forms of spiral curtains. The whole display after lasting a half hour moved to N. of zenith fading as it went. ",http://oldweather.s3.amazonaws.com/ow3/final/USS%20Jeannette/vol002of004/vol002_077_1.jpg,

About 9pm there was a remarkable auroral display which is described by Lieut. Chipp as follows: ""At about 8.50pm there were 3 auroral curtains extending in arches from a mass of green and yellow light near the N.W. horizon to near the east horizon. The upper arch was about 60° and the others about 45° and 30° respectively. The highest arch was the most brilliant. The general color was a bright yellow. Suddenly a brown-red color flashed across from N.W. to E., and the curtains were violently agitated. Luminous rays formed, darting across the curtains with variable lengths. Meanwhile the curtains undulated violently with short quick waves from N.W. to E., and at the same time would change their altitudes up and down about 5°, keeping about the same space apart. The darting of rays and rapid undulations, gave the arches the appearance of torrents of light rushing from N.W. to E. The lower parts of the curtains were cherry-red, next green, while the greater part was of a bright yellow. The cherry-red rays from the bases of the curtains flashing in with rays of green and yellow caused many colors to be seen, so that the lower halves of the curtains looked not unlike irregular rainbows violently agitated. During this display the north end of the galvanometer needles connected in the cabin was deflected 20° E. (not an unusual amount) having been 10° east at 8pm and again at 9.10pm when the great brilliancy had ceased."" 
Another description, by Lieut. DeLong is as follows: ""At 9pm from the N.W. horizon there projected upward a curving column of brilliant green and reddish-pink light in violent movement (resembling the movement but far exceeding the brightness of a flame shooting from a Castan signal light) which, while undergoing twistings and undulations every half second spread out at an altitude of 10° above the horizon into 3 magnificent curtain arches spanning the sky at altitudes of 35° 40° and 45° respectively and extending to the eastern horizon. These arches were in a state of violent agitation, flashing, trembling and pulsating every half second while receiving and passing along repeated changes from the supplying column. The upper portion of each curtain was of the usual greenish-white color, the middle portion was of a vivid pale green; and the under portion consisted of an exceedingly delicate pink fringe which trembled and quivered without rest. Numerous bands above and beneath the arch showed the pulsations of colored lights also but to no very marked extent. In about 15 minutes the supply seemed to diminish in the column and the lights to grow faint. The arches and bands then rose, massing at the zenith in an arch 10° in width while some of the pulsations were repeated, but backward, as if returning to their source, and the broad arch separated into several narrower ones, loops, and coronas, leaving the sky in a state of general illumination.""

“At Midnight the auroral display was all S of the zenith between N.W. and S.E. and in broken arches and segments of curtains between 10° and 45° in altitude. A faint pink and green tinge would show occasionally, but the whole affair looked ended and completed.” "
