Aurora observations from the log books of the 19th century Arctic explorer USS Jeannette as transcribed by volunteers from the Zooniverse Old Weather project (http://classic.oldweather.org),,,,,,
,Ship positions are converted to standard time (UT) and with gaps filled by linear interpolation.  https://github.com/oldweather/oldWeather3/blob/master/by_voyage/Jeannette/positions.utc.interpolated.txt,,,,,

Date line,"The ship crossed the international date line several times but the date in the log was not amended, the correct (local) date was, however, noted in red ink in the log. The uncorrected ship's log dates are used as this maintains a record in GMT/UT -12 hours.",,,,,

log book url,A link to the original log book page is given for each aurora observation. ,,,,,

Corrected Geomagnetic Coordinates,Conversion calculator:       http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/vitmo/cgm_vitmo.html  With date set to 1900,,,,,

midnight,A watch was from midnight to midnight. 00:00 or “midnight” in the logs generally refers to the end rather than the beginning of a watch. ,,,,,

3 hourly aa index ,"http://www.ukssdc.ac.uk/wdcc1/data_menu.html    aa values use ship dates and times converted to UT. The aa index and log observation timings do not always match. The nearest aa value to the log entry time is used. Where a log entry time is half way between two aa index times the earlier time is used – eg for a log time of 01:30, the aa value for 00:00 is used.  Where there are multiple auroral displays recorded per 24 hour watch, the maximum aa value corresponding to an actual observation time is used. ",,,,,
